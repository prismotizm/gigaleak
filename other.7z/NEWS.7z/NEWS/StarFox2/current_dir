Description: This contains the source code for Star Fox 2, a game which was cancelled right after being finished, and wasn't released until many years later. If you look in BRIEF\BACKUP\HOSTDATA.DAT, you can see all the internal emails sent between Argonaut employees. There's a bunch of fucking weird shit in there.
