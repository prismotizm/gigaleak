Description: This contains data from tape archives of old Sony NEWS workstations. These likely were the workstations used to make many of the games for the SNES. Supposedly, there were about 50 of these tapes, which were left to sit for multiple years. Nintendo had attempted to recover them sometime in 2016, but only 7 of them were recoverable. There is a whole lot of source code and development data in these archives. Who knows what could have been in the ones that couldn't be recovered? It saddens me.
